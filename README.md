# About Ericbot
Ericbot is a closed source community driven twitch bot, run by ericw9079.

Ericbot admins are twitch users who have been issued admin by ericw9079.

Ericbot was initially intended to be a fun interactive twitch bot. However missuse of ericbot has required policies and subsystems to be implemented.

# Quotes
The quotes for a community/channel are stored in the respective quotes <channelname>.txt file
Ericbot indexes the quotes starting at 0 so the quote on line one is quote 0 in ericbot.
Quotes can be suggested by using the !suggestquote command. However ericw9079 reserves the right to edit and or decline any and all quotes submitted to ericbot, this is to ensure that they always align with his and the communities values and standards. All suggested quotes must be relevant to the community for which they are suggested.

# Reputation
Missuse of ericbot has resulted in the implementation of a reputation subsystem.
Your ericbot reputation defines which commands you are allowed to use and is global, meaning it is persistant accross channels.
Should your reputation fall below 0, ericbot will not respond to any command you issue.
Your reputation is increased by being nice to ericbot, or using ericbot to be nice to the community. (ie. saying hello, goodbye, etc.)
Your reputation is decreased by being mean/toxic to ericbot and the community. (ie.using !bop or swearing)
Any questions about reputation can be directed to ericw9079 or an ericbot admin.

# Blacklist
Ericbot contains a global blacklist, meaning its enforced REGARDLESS of the channel.

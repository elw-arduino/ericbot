# About Ericbot
Ericbot was a closed source community driven twitch bot, run by ericw9079.
On twitch Ericbot goes by ericw9079_bot hereinafter referred to as Ericbot.
Ericbot admins are twitch users who have been issued admin by ericw9079.

Ericbot was initially intended to be a fun interactive twitch bot. However, misuse of Ericbot has required policies and subsystems to be implemented.

# Quotes
The quotes for a community/channel are stored in the respective quotes <channelname>.txt file
Ericbot indexes the quotes starting at 0 so the quote on line 1 is quote 0 in Ericbot.
Quotes can be suggested by using the !suggestquote command. However, ericw9079 reserves the right to edit and or decline any quotes submitted to Ericbot, this is to ensure that they always align with his and the communityâ€™s values and standards. All suggested quotes must be relevant to the community for which they are suggested.

# Reputation
Misuse of Ericbot has resulted in the implementation of a reputation subsystem.
Your Ericbot reputation defines which commands you can use and is global, meaning it is persistent across channels.
Should your reputation fall below 0, Ericbot will not respond to any command you issue.
Your reputation is increased by being nice to Ericbot or using Ericbot to be nice to the community. (i.e. saying hello, goodbye, etc.)
Your reputation is decreased by being mean/toxic to Ericbot and the community. (i.e. using !bop or swearing)
Any questions about reputation can be directed to ericw9079 or an Ericbot admin.

# Can I farm reputation?
NO, Ericbot reputation is not intended to be farmed. Anyone caught farming Ericbot reputation by an Ericbot admin will have their reputation reset. Repeated farming will result in a blacklist. If you suspect someone of farming reputation, please contact either ericw9079 or an Ericbot admin.

# Disrespecting Ericbot
Even though Ericbot may be a bot with no real feelings, Ericbot should receive the same respect as you would give another person.
Being disrespectful towards Ericbot WILL result in a loss of reputation. And in serious cases ALSO result in a BLACKLIST.
Threatening the "life" of Ericbot in any way Is considered a serious issue and WILL result in a BLACKLIST.

# Blacklist
Ericbot contains a global blacklist, meaning its enforced REGARDLESS of the channel.
Only ericw9079 can edit this blacklist. However, Ericbot admins may report users to him.
Being on the blacklist means: Ericbot will IGNORE ALL MESSAGES from you, and the result of !reputation is changed to reflect the blacklist.
YOU WILL NOT BE REMOVED IF YOU ASK.

# Commands
Please note that all commands except for ?help & ?policy have a 60 second cooldown to prevent Ericbot and its commands from spamming the chat. This cooldown however is per command, meaning you can run !reputation and !cutie right after each other with no problems.

Note for twitch-mods of the channels Ericbot operates within: Some of the cooldowns can be changed and even toggled depending on what you want. How to do this is stated just below.
